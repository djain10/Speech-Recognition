# Speech-Recognition

#### Diagnosing Speech/Language Development Disorders using Amazon's Alexa


## Inspiration

After seeing the struggles of children suffering with communication difficulties, we were compelled to create a solution that would allow a cost effective way of diagnosing children with Speech/Language Developmental Delays

## What it does
Using Amazon Alexa's voice recognition, we are able to recognize speech patterns that are commonly indicative of Speech Disorders in children and young adults.

## How we built it
- Amazon's Alexa Skill Kit- Lamdaused Natural Language Processing in text analysis and calculating various metrics.

- Research on Childhood Speech/Developmental Disorders

## How we built it

-	Amazon's Alexa Skill Kit (Client facing portion of the skill)

- AWS Lambda (Backend and Natural Language Processing)

- Python's Flask Framework (Backend for website containing Diagnostic info)

- Chart.js (For data visualization)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We were successfully able to generate thousands of predetermined misspoken words and match them with commonly diagnosed speech disorder

- By using thousands of slots in the Alexa skill, we were able to get the full speech transcript from the user (Something that is not currently supported with Alexa skills)

## What's next for Speakly

- Diagnosing additionally speech disorders using the same technology

- Potentially pivoting to individuals learning additional a second language
